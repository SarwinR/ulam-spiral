# ulam-spiral
 A visualization of the Ulam spiral or Prime spiral using python.

The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later. It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers. [Wikipedia, 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)
